1. Introduction

Hello everyone, today I will walk you through the Uber performance analysis for July 2024.
This dashboard covers overall performance, vehicle type insights, revenue patterns, cancellations, and ratings.
The goal is to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.

2. Overall Performance 
	• In July 2024, Uber recorded 103,024 bookings with a total booking value of 35 million.
	• Out of these, 63,967 bookings were successful while the rest were either cancelled or drivers were not found.
	• The success rate stands at 62%, meaning 38% of rides failed, which is quite significant.
📌 Booking Status Breakdown:
	• Successful Rides: 63.97K (62%).
	• Driver Cancellations: 18.43K (18%).
	• Customer Cancellations: 10.5K (10%).
	• Driver Not Found: 10.12K (10%).
👉 This shows that cancellations and driver availability are major challenges.
👉 Ride volume per day was fairly steady, averaging around 3,000–3,400 rides daily.

3. Vehicle Type Analysis
Looking at the vehicle-wise performance:
	• Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Prime Plus, Mini, Bike, Auto, and E-Bike are almost equally contributing to revenue.

📌 Key Highlights:
	• Prime Sedan: Highest success booking value at 5.22M.

	• By payment method:
		○ Cash dominates with ~19M (55%).

		○ Credit/Debit Cards together <5%.
	• Daily revenue is consistent between 45K–55K per day, showing stable demand.
	• Customer analysis shows revenue is evenly distributed, no single customer dominates.
👉 Insight: Uber should push digital payments (UPI, cards) by offering discounts or cashback to reduce dependency on cash handling.

5. Cancellation Analysis 
This is the most critical area.
	• Total cancellations: 28,933.
	• Cancellation Rate: 28.08% ⚠️ (ideally should be <15–20%).

👉 Overall Insights:
	• Driver cancellations are nearly double customer cancellations.

7. Final Recommendations 
	1. Reduce Cancellations:
		○ Train drivers to avoid “asking to cancel”.

		○ Market as eco-friendly rides.
	4. Encourage Digital Payments:
		○ Push UPI/cards with offers → reduce reliance on cash.
	5. Maintain Ratings Stability:

		○ Encourage loyalty among premium customers (Prime Plus, SUV).

8. Conclusion
